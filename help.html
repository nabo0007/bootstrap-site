  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    There are a lot of different opinions about climate change. Most people know that pollution is a big piece of it. Climate change is a change in common weather for places for instance how hot it usually is or how much rain or snow drops in a season. Climate changes occor over long periods of time.

    <h3 class="panel-title">Causes of climate change</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    There are many things to factor in when it comes to climate change. Our distance from the sun can change, oceans change and even when volcanos errupt our climate changes. Humans also have a big part in it. We drive cars, heat our homes, cook food, travel and we manufacture anything we need. All this requires energy and we get some of that energy from burning fossil fuels that release <b>Greenhouse gasses</b>.

    <h3 class="panel-title">Greenhouse Gasses</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
       Our Earth has a presious inviible layer called out atmosphere. When we get heat from the sun our atmosphere traps in some of that heat and keeps Earth warm, without this layer Earth would be a frozen rock floating in space. Greenhouse gasses go up in our atmosphere and trap more heat in which causes our planet to warm up more than it should naturally.

    <h3 class="panel-title">What will happen</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  Scientists belive that Earths temperature will continue to rise for the next 100 years. Thry belive that more ice and snow will melt, this could cause Oceans levels to rise. Places could get hotter or colder, more rain or snow and even an increase in natural disasters.

    <h3 class="panel-title">How can you help</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  A way anyone can help is to try using less energy, maybe instead of driving 1 person in a car, carpool even take the bus. Turn off lights, TV's, Monitors etc when you aren't using them. Don't keep the tap running and maybe take some time and plant a tree or two.
